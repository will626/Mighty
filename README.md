***FOR THE NAVBAR TO WORK YOU MUST LOAD UNSAFE SCRIPTS IN THE LIVELENGTH****
James Michael Garland, William Russell Dixon, and Dallas Joshua Moragne have comprised their talents and efforts into making the most well thought out, desgined website of all time. Mighty is the production of cooperation, effort, and a conscious decision to care. We came together for this project because we actually wanted to ignite a diffference in our community when it came to the safety of children in abusive relationships. Our site exhibits all the key qualities and designs of a top notch website and allows easy accesss and directibility throughout the entire ccampus of  Mighthy.
  I, Dallas Moragne, was in charge of adding in all the content into the website to spruce it up and give it some pop and flavor. People want to actually know what they are getting into when they venture into the deep abysses of a website. My job was to basically be their tour guide through the treacherous terrains of Mighty. Some of the content I have added into the website includes: information about the site, the founders, our goal, and mission statement.
  1)	About:
a)	Mighty is a non-profitable organization that is supplying hope to the domestically abused youth. We realize the importance that a simple gift such as the small donation of a stuffed animal can have on a victim of a domestic violence.
2)	Goals:
a)	Bring awareness to the issue.
b)	Reach donation goals.
c)	Make a positive impact in the children’s lives.
3)	Mission Statement:
a)	We do this because we genuinely care and if we’re being honest people don’t have that sort of passion anymore, we are seeking to make a difference through the most effective means necessary.
4)	Founders:
a)	William Dixon: Will is our level headed leader. He has ventured out of his comfort zone and found an exciting new interest working on this project. He has a genuine knack for getting people together to make a real difference. He wants to give back to the community that has provided so much for him. Upon embarking on the quest to make Mighty, Will has realized how much love and passion he has towards his community and what it stands for. He sought out to actually make a difference for the ones that have little to nothing. Mighty is here to provide for the mistreated and malnourished.
b)	Jack: a 17-year-old ingenuitive genius, Jack is a senior at Madison Academic. His creativity and sturdy work ethic helps when it comes to multitasking and knocking out difficult tasks. Jack has a good sense of knowing what’s right versus what’s wrong and that is why he was so enthusiastic when it came to getting on board with Mighty. He saw the good cause for what it was and knew he could add something to the mix to further develop the vision.
c)	Kyle Greene: Kyle is a 17-year-old attendee of Madison Academic as well. Kyle is our social gauntlet, providing character and a broader perspective to the outlook of the website. Unlike any other, Kyle can sense what it takes to catch people’s attention and get them to care about a cause. In this kind of business, hooking your audience in is so important and that’s why we value Kyle to such an extent.
d)	Clay Simpson: Clay is an 18-year-old senior student at Madison Academic. Clay loves playing baseball and spends the majority of his time comforting companions and putting smiles on other’s faces. Clay is the back bone of Mighty. His silent but serious demeanor keeps the group on task while focusing on important decisions and future moves. He helps us aim for a higher goal each and every day.
Along with the process of adding in all the content came the actual development of the website itself.
Will Dixon is in charge of designing and progressing the website's development. He included the NavBar (which jack found) coded the main base of the website, and he organized the color scheme of the site along with the framework and outline.
Jack Garland is the co-producer of the
Our lead developer was William Russell Dixon. He was the core component in developing the website and integrating code into every bit and piece of the project. James Michael Garland was a huge contributor in developing the inner workings of certain aspects of each individual page. The site really pops up with life and energy after James adds his magic touch.
